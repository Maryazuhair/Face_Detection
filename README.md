# Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project implements face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. The goal is to detect faces in real-time video streams from a webcam or from an image.



## Introduction
Face detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating human faces in an image or a video. This project leverages OpenCVâ€™s pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers to achieve real-time face detection.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maryazuhair/Face_Detection.git
```
### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Results
The model detects faces in both images and video streams. You can visualize the detection by bounding boxes drawn around faces.
